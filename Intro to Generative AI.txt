# INTRO TO GENERATIVE AI
------------------------

* What is Generative AI
-----------------------
Artificial Intelligence (or AI) is a fast-evolving field of technology that lets computers simulate human functions, such as learning and problem-solving. A subset of AI that’s been 
gaining traction recently is generative AI. This branch of AI specializes in creating new content, be it text, images, audio, or videos.

How is this AI able to be so creative? Generative AI is trained using vast amounts of data, for example, billions of sentences, millions of images, or years of audio. By analyzing these 
inputs, the AI identifies patterns and rules and then uses these to generate new, original content in a similar style or format.

There are many real-world examples of generative AI in use today, including ChatGPT, which can generate text, and Dall-E, which can create artwork.

Let’s dive deeper into the many forms of generative AI and learn how we can best use these new technologies!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Text-Based Generative AI
--------------------------
Some of the greatest possibilities open up when AI meets text. Text-based generative AI has the ability to produce human-like writing, making it a powerful tool for many applications.

A popular example of this technology is ChatGPT, an AI model trained on millions of web pages. This training is what gives ChatGPT its knowledge of modern topics and the ability to give 
realistic output.

To be more specific, it can create written content, such as articles or blog posts, making content writers more productive and allowing domain experts to communicate their ideas more 
easily. These generative AIs can also automate common interactions, such as email responses or chatbot conversations, providing more expedient and accurate customer service. Or assist in 
routine tasks like scheduling meetings or sending reminders, effectively acting as a virtual assistant.

One surprising application of text-based AI is personalized tutoring. An AI can be programmed to answer specific questions on content, providing a unique learning experience tailored to 
each individual. Or if the user wants to read content originally from another language, the AI can translate the text as well.

For business applications, generative text AIs have made progress in data reporting and analyzing and summarizing data. They have also found use in programming, where they have been used 
to generate code for simple tasks or edit existing code to reduce errors.

So many aspects of our digital culture can be represented as text. By understanding text-based generative AIs, exciting possibilities open up across a wide variety of fields.

* Image-Based Generative AI
---------------------------
Some of the most impressive results from generative AIs come from those that generate images. With only a text description, masterpieces can easily be generated, even on most home 
computers.

A remarkable example of this technology is Dall-E. It is trained using millions of images from the internet, giving it the capability to generate images about any topic and imitating the 
art style of any era.

So, what are the applications of image-based generative AI? Besides creating completely new images, this AI can also modify existing images based on inputted templates. This 
revolutionizes the graphic design industry, allowing those with less artistic talent to more easily convey their ideas and designs.

AI can also be used to customize designs in sectors like clothing or architecture before beginning manufacturing or construction, saving resources and improving customer satisfaction. It 
can further be used to help train workers. For example, images for specific diagnoses can be generated to train medical professionals about rare diseases or surgeries, without violating a 
patient’s privacy.

Any modern use of images can be enhanced by this type of generative AI. By learning how to best use it, anyone can improve their communication by generating new works of art.

While this technology is incredible, what other artwork does it know about by name? How do the artists of these works feel about their inclusion in AI and the ability of others to 
generate new art based on it?

* Audio-Based Generative AI
---------------------------
The applications for audio-based generative AI are truly diverse. Whether creating new voices, original songs, or sounds of animals in a rainforest, there are many possibilities.

For music creation, audio-based generative AI can use a simple text description to create entirely new compositions or finish an existing song. This could lead to more innovative sounds 
as musicians are able to more easily move past traditional instruments.

Another significant application is text-to-speech conversion. This AI capability can convert written text into spoken words that carry natural-sounding inflection and tonality, which can 
be instrumental in accessibility tools or interactive customer service.

A related, but more advanced application of audio-based AI is voice cloning, where an AI system can mimic a specific person’s voice for uses such as dubbing films or providing voiceovers.

AI can also be used in audio restoration and enhancement, improving the quality of old or noisy recordings. This can have significant applications in preserving historical records or 
enhancing sound quality in existing media.

The world of audio-based generative AI is fascinating, with the potential to significantly impact various sectors of our society.

* Video-Based Generative AI
---------------------------
At the intersection of images and audio is video-based generative AI.

Many of the applications for this type of AI are more advanced combinations of the previous image and audio examples. For example, video-based generative AI can replace the appearance of 
one person with the likeness of another in a video, a technique known as “facial replacement” or “deepfake.” This capability can fundamentally change the film and advertising industry, 
possibly leading to more personalized content generated on demand.

This type of AI is also great for boosting efficiency and creativity in production by automating certain video editing and special effects tasks. Along with this, AIs can also generate 
synthetic video data for use in training autonomous vehicles, security teams, and medical professionals.

Video-based generative AI can be a great help to existing video as well. For videos such as sporting events, AI can create analytic overlays providing real-time insights, enhancing the 
viewer experience. AI can also be used to enhance low-quality or damaged videos, which was not previously possible.

Video-based generative AI is another example of the revolutionary impact this technology can have across a wide variety of industries.
