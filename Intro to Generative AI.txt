# INTRO TO GENERATIVE AI
------------------------

* What is Generative AI
-----------------------
Artificial Intelligence (or AI) is a fast-evolving field of technology that lets computers simulate human functions, such as learning and problem-solving. A subset of AI that’s been 
gaining traction recently is generative AI. This branch of AI specializes in creating new content, be it text, images, audio, or videos.

How is this AI able to be so creative? Generative AI is trained using vast amounts of data, for example, billions of sentences, millions of images, or years of audio. By analyzing these 
inputs, the AI identifies patterns and rules and then uses these to generate new, original content in a similar style or format.

There are many real-world examples of generative AI in use today, including ChatGPT, which can generate text, and Dall-E, which can create artwork.

Let’s dive deeper into the many forms of generative AI and learn how we can best use these new technologies!

* Text-Based Generative AI
--------------------------
Some of the greatest possibilities open up when AI meets text. Text-based generative AI has the ability to produce human-like writing, making it a powerful tool for many applications.

A popular example of this technology is ChatGPT, an AI model trained on millions of web pages. This training is what gives ChatGPT its knowledge of modern topics and the ability to give 
realistic output.

To be more specific, it can create written content, such as articles or blog posts, making content writers more productive and allowing domain experts to communicate their ideas more 
easily. These generative AIs can also automate common interactions, such as email responses or chatbot conversations, providing more expedient and accurate customer service. Or assist in 
routine tasks like scheduling meetings or sending reminders, effectively acting as a virtual assistant.

One surprising application of text-based AI is personalized tutoring. An AI can be programmed to answer specific questions on content, providing a unique learning experience tailored to 
each individual. Or if the user wants to read content originally from another language, the AI can translate the text as well.

For business applications, generative text AIs have made progress in data reporting and analyzing and summarizing data. They have also found use in programming, where they have been used 
to generate code for simple tasks or edit existing code to reduce errors.

So many aspects of our digital culture can be represented as text. By understanding text-based generative AIs, exciting possibilities open up across a wide variety of fields.
